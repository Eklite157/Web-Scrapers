# Two OpenLibrary Web-Scrapers

A Python-based trivia game using Tkinter for the GUI, pandas for question management, and Pillow for image handling.

## Motivation
As an person who has an avid interest in classic novels, I'm always on the hunt for more interesting selections to read. After learning Python and webscraping, I thought I could employ these skills for my own purposes, such as going onto certain online book websites to gather well-rated classic novels to add to my reading list without having to personally click and investigate each book for the relevant information. I've been on the Open Library website every now and then and its classics section had 80 pages that would have taken me far too long to comb through, so I decided to attempt web scraping instead.
